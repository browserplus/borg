# Your Web, Powered by Yahoo! BrowserPlus

We're delighted to offer you Yahoo! BrowserPlus, a small but powerful add-on that helps websites bring rich features to your web browser. With
BrowserPlus installed on your computer, you can experience faster, more exciting web site features. For instance, Yahoo! Mail comes alive with
BrowserPlus: you can drag and drop files into the compose message window and even do simple photo touchups right from your inbox.

When you install BrowserPlus from a non-Yahoo! website, you get the core platform and the set of features required by the website to run their
web applications. As problems are fixed and new versions are available, we'll automatically update your software with the latest fixes. Every
update we send is audited and digitally signed, so you're ensured only authentic updates approved by Yahoo! are installed on your computer.
