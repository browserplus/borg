# BrowserPlus Documentation

BrowserPlus.org is a resource to help developers create sites
which use BrowserPlus and to create new services.  The documentation
presently available is targeted at three different classes of
developers, click through to the documentation that you're interested
in:

**[Web Developers](/docs/developer/web_dev/)** -- You're interested in
using the portable JavaScript APIs that the BrowserPlus platform and 
library of services expose. 

**[Service Authors](/docs/developer/services/)** -- You want to build
a plugin for the web that's scriptable from Javascript and works almost 
everywhere, in either native code or a high level language.

**[Web Platform Developers](/docs/developer/platform/)** -- You're
curious about how the BrowserPlus platform works to extend it, build
on top of it, or build native support for BrowserPlus style plugins
into a web agent.
