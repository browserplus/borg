# BrowserPlus Documentation

BrowserPlus.org is a developer site focused on helping developers creating sites using BrowserPlus,
creating new services, and pushing the core platform forward.

*Note*: We're currently migrating developer documentation from the original 
[BrowserPlus site](http://browserplus.yahoo.com/).  Please refer there for any missing
docs.

## Developers

What type of BrowserPlus developer are you?  If you are using BrowserPlus in a web application, 
you are a [web developer](/docs/developer/web_dev/).  If you want to create your own service, 
you are a [service developer](/docs/developer/service_dev/).  Either way, you'll want to take 
a look at the [available services](/docs/developer/services/).
