# BrowserPlus Documentation

BrowserPlus.org is a developer site focused on helping developers creating sites using BrowserPlus,
creating new services, and pushing the core platform forward.

*Note*: We're currently migrating developer documentation from the original 
[BrowserPlus site](http://browserplus.yahoo.com/).  Please refer there for any missing
docs.
