# Overview

*BrowserPlus* is a proposal and reference implementation for a new
type of scriptable web plugins (or "services").  These services can be
used from regular web apps and add new JavaScript APIs for features like:
 
+ Desktop Notifications
+ Peer To Peer File Transfer
+ Client side Compression and Archiving
+ Device Access (like the Motion sensor or Accelerometer on modern laptops) 
+ Client side storage

## Choose Your Own Adventure 

This website is a resource to both help developers use BrowserPlus in
their web applications and to create new services.  The documentation
presently available is targeted at three different classes of
developers, click through to the documentation that you're interested
in:

**[Web Developers](/docs/web_dev/)**: You're interested in
using the new JavaScript APIs provided by BrowserPlus to build advanced
features into your web applications.  Documentation and 
[example code](/docs/web_dev/example_code/) included.

**[Service Authors](/docs/service_dev/)**: You want to build a plugin
for the web that's scriptable from Javascript and works almost
everywhere, in either native code or a high level language.

**[Browser Technologists](/docs/platform/)**: You're
curious about how the BrowserPlus platform works to extend it, build
on top of it, or build native support for BrowserPlus plugins into an
existing application (like, say, a web browser).

## Adventures for All

**[Available Services](/docs/services/)**: BrowserPlus doesn't ship with
pre-installed services. Instead services are downloaded, installed and
updated on the fly. No need to wait for the next big release for new
functionality or fixes.  Check out the list of services currently
available.


**[Demos](/docs/demos/)**: From image processing to advanced uploading,
motion sensing to cross-domain JSON requests, Demos showscases more
complete examples of BrowserPlus in action.

**[Widgets](/docs/widgets/)**: The widgets on these pages allow for easy 
BrowserPlus integration on your website. Just include a script, set some 
optional parameters and make your site more capable.

**[FAQ](/docs/FAQ/)**: Answers to frequently asked questions.
