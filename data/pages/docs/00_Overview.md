# Overview

*BrowserPlus* is a proposal and reference implementation of a new 
type of web plugins, called "services".  These services can be used
from regular webpages and add new JavaScript APIs to most modern 
browsers to provide features like:
 
+ Desktop Notifications
+ Peer To Peer File Transfer
+ Client side Compression and Archiving
+ Device Access (like the Motion sensor or Accelerometer on modern laptops) 
+ Client side storage
+ etc...

## Choose Your Own Adventure 

This website is a resource to help developers use BrowserPlus in
their web applications and to create new services.  The documentation
presently available is targeted at three different classes of
developers, click through to the documentation that you're interested
in:

**[Web Developers](/docs/web_dev/)** -- You're interested in
using the portable JavaScript APIs that the BrowserPlus platform and 
library of services expose. 

**[Service Authors](/docs/services/)** -- You want to build
a plugin for the web that's scriptable from Javascript and works almost 
everywhere, in either native code or a high level language.

**[Web Technologists](/docs/platform/)** -- You're
curious about how the BrowserPlus platform works to extend it, build
on top of it, or build native support for BrowserPlus plugins into an
application.
