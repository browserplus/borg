# The BrowserPlus Developer

BrowserPlus is an open source dynamic plugin framework that makes it possible to rapidly extend the browser
programming environment with new javascript APIs that afford secure access to desktop facilities. This site
contains code samples, tutorials, and formal documentation for the platform.

Once you have an understanding of the basic usage of the platform, the Service Explorer allows you to explore and
execute the APIs of all services available today: A continually evolving feature set.

## How Does it work?

The BrowserPlus platform is a couple web browser plugins and some supporting programs. The end-user installs the
platform as they would any client software. Once BrowserPlus is installed, web page authors can detect its
presence, and require the specific services that they would like to leverage in their site. If services are not
installed on the client machine, the end user is prompted for their installation. On the fly, plugins are
"activated" (downloaded and installed), and are immediately available in the browser without a restart.

## What are the benefits of BrowserPlus?

For **end-users** BrowserPlus makes installing, updating, and deleting plugins much easier:

* No more browser restarts
* Clear language about what plugins do.
* Simple granting and revocation of permissions on a per-page basis
* New features that work across all popular browsers!

**Web Developers** gain access to a growing set of features that work the same across browsers and platforms. They
have robust tools for specifying the versions of services they want to use, and they access all of this
functionality through a simple and symmetric API.

**Service Developers** get a simplified development cycle. The platform has built-in a lot of the stuff we used to
have to write. Versioning, update, revocation, and distribution are all handled by the platform, so a developer
gets to focus on the core functionality they want to expose, and NOT a bunch of disparate browser APIs and update
mechanisms. Want to prototype an idea quickly? Write it in Ruby!
