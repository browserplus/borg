# How do I "send a bug report"?

BrowserPlus has a built in mechanism for sending bug reports.  This
allows you to share a small amount of anonymous information that
can help us diagnose and quickly fix issues with the software.  Sending
a report is easy:

1. reproduce the issue inside your web browser
2. STOP
3. open up the BrowserPlus control panel.  
  a. On windows this is `Start -> Programs -> BrowserPlus -> Configuration`
  b. On OSX this is found in `Start -> Programs -> BrowserPlus -> Configuration`
4. Click on the "Troubleshooting" tab
5. Include some descriptive text about what site you were visiting and what you did when the problem happened.
6. click send!

Subsequent to sending your report you can drop us a note [on twitter](http://twitter.com/browserplus) to follow up.

Finally, please make sure you supply any relevant links in your bug report, as this will help us get to the bottom of things.

The trouble shooting tab looks like this:
