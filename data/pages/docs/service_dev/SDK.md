If you're interested in developing services, there are a couple tools here that will be of use. The SDK includes:

1. [C Headers](http://github.com/browserplus/platform/tree/master/src/sdk/service_api/api/ServiceAPI/) for writing native services
2. Full documentation for the Service API
3. Sample [Ruby](http://github.com/browserplus/platform/tree/master/src/sdk/sample_services/RubyService/) and 
   [Native](http://github.com/browserplus/platform/tree/master/src/sdk/sample_services/NativeService/) services
4. a command line installer and validator program

The sdk will unpack into a directory called bpsdk/ , see the top level
[README](http://github.com/browserplus/platform/blob/master/src/libs/installer/misc/README.txt) for instructions on how to
get started.
