# Image Twiddler

Image Twiddler is a demonstration of a fairly complete client application, which supports client side image editing inside a
web browser. The small application ties together the ideas presented previously, using @{service ImageAlter} and @{service
DragAndDrop}.

Please note that this example is based off of the older ImageAlter 2 code base. The ImageAlter 4 service has a different API
and is substantially faster.
