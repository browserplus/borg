# Spacebook

Everybody is getting social these days. What could be friendlier than your smiling face gracing
each and every web page. And let's not forget our alien friends. This example is a simplified
version of the PhotoDrop demo, showing how a few hundred lines of JavaScript code can create a
best-of-breed, easy-to-use, profile creation tool

## Discussion

Use @{s DragAndDrop}, @{s FileAccess}, @{s ImageAlter} and @{s Uploader} to create a easy to use
profile tool. Users drag and drop photos from the desktop and manipulate the image on their own
CPU so your servers won't be busy twiddling image bits. Uploads are faster too as images are
scaled before the upload, saving your user's time and your VC's dimes on your storage and bandwidth
bill ;-)
