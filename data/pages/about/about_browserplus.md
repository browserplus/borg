# About BrowserPlus

BrowserPlus is an open source project created and sponsored by [Yahoo!](http://www.yahoo.com/)

## What is BrowserPlus

BrowserPlus is a browser technology that allows developers to create rich web applications with desktop
capabilities. Downloads, demonstrations and the bulk of the documentation can currently can found on
<http://browserplus.yahoo.com>. BrowserPlus is in production on [Yahoo! Mail](http://mail.yahoo.com).

BrowserPlus can be installed and updated without a Browser or OS restart. Services are **not built** into the
core, but installed on demand. What this means is that features (services) can be added without modifying or
redistributing the core platform.  Once the platform is installed, your users are just 80KB away from 
[zipping](http://browserplus.yahoo.com/developer/explore/?s=Zipper) their uploads.

Plus, BrowserPlus runs on the client. Want to offer the next photo or video processing site? Save big on servers,
cause the processing all happens on the client.  Your servers do not change.

Once installed, BrowserPlus stays up-to-date via a RESTful JSON 
[web services api](http://browserplus.yahoo.com/api/v3/corelets/win32).

## Who is BrowserPlus.org

BrowserPlus is Dave, Gordon, Lloyd and Steve. We're all full time Yahoo! employees and we all work from home
*(nice gig if you can get it)*. Since we are geographically diverse, we stay in touch via IRC. If you have a
question, drop on in at `irc.freenode.net #browserplus`.

## What, No Linux!!!

Well, open sourcing a previously closed source project is not most productive endeavor, coding wise. We've talked
to the lawyers, sat in on the conference calls, commented the code and cleansed the curses. Now with a little bit
of time and maybe a little bit of open source magic, we can focus on moving the platform forward.
