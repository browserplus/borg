# About BrowserPlus

BrowserPlus is an open source project created and sponsored by [Yahoo!](http://www.yahoo.com/)

## What is BrowserPlus

BrowserPlus is a browser technology that allows web developers to create rich web applications with desktop
capabilities. What type of capabilities?  Drag and drop from the desktop, display native notifications
(with Growl), compress and archive files (with ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2 and LZMA), image manipulation and 
much, much more.  Check out all the [services](/docs/services), [demos](/demos/) and [docs](/docs/).

Backed by multiple servers in multiple COLOs around the world, BrowserPlus is in production and is ready
for your website too.  BrowserPlus is run millions of times a day by millions of users.  The biggest
email site in the world, [Yahoo! Mail](http://mail.yahoo.com), uses BrowserPlus to handle email attachments.

BrowserPlus can be installed and updated without a Browser or OS restart. Services are **not built** into the
core, but installed on demand. What this means is that features (services) can be added without modifying or
redistributing the core platform.  Once the platform is installed, your users are just 80KB away from 
[zipping](http://browserplus.yahoo.com/developer/explore/?s=Zipper) their uploads.

Want to offer the next photo or video processing site? Save big on servers and bandwidth,
cause BrowserPlus does all the processing on the client.  

Once installed, BrowserPlus stays up-to-date via a RESTful JSON 
[web services api](http://browserplus.yahoo.com/api/v3/corelets/win32).

## What, No Linux!!!

Well, open sourcing a previously closed source project is not the most productive endeavor, coding wise. We've talked
to the lawyers, sat in on the conference calls, commented the code and cleansed the curses. Now with a little bit
of time and maybe a little bit of open source magic, we can focus on moving the platform forward.  For the latest
on our port, refer to the [linux porting](http://github.com/browserplus/platform/blob/master/docs/LinuxPorting.txt)
document.
